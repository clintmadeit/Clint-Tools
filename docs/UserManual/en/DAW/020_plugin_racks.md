# Plugin Racks
The plugin racks host all of your instrument and effect plugins.  Stargate
uses it's own high quality, CPU efficient plugins, in it's own plugin format.
This allows us to create a DAW that works on every operating system and CPU
architecture, with portable project files that can be shared for easy
collaboration.

Each plugin rack receives input from a sequencer track.  You can open a track's
plugin rack by clicking on the dropdown on the sequencer track and clicking
the "Show Plugins" button.

All instrument plugins pass-through their audio.  You can layer multiple
instrument plugins, or send audio through them, mixing it with the output
of the instrument.
