# Routing
This tab allows you to control the routing of audio and MIDI throughout the
project.  Use cases include:
- Effect processing, busses, sends
- Sidechain effects such as vocoder and sidechain compressor
- MIDI routing

See the tooltip help for the mouse modifiers to set each type of route.

# Types of Sends
## Audio
Route audio from one track to another.

## Sidechain
Route audio to the sidechain input of a plugin rack.  This only makes sense if
that rack is using a sidechain-enabled plugin.

## MIDI
Send all of the MIDI events from one plugin rack to another
