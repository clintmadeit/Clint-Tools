# Transport
The DAW transport adds additional controls to the standard transport.

# Loop Mode
This allows you to loop your project.  Currently, the only supported modes are
`Off` and `Region`.  To loop a region, first set the region start and end in
the sequencer header by right-clicking.

# Mouse Tools
These buttons will appear or disappear depending on which tab is open.  They
are mapped to the hotkeys a, s, d, f, so you can keep your right hand on
the mouse, and use your left hand to switch mouse tools.
